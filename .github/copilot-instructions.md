# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is a collection of student code samples organized by language:
- `C++/initial.cpp`: C++ code samples
- `code.c/a.c`: C code samples
- `HTML/index.HTML`: HTML code sample
- `python/`: (currently empty)

There is no build system, test framework, or automation scripts present. Each language folder is independent and contains standalone files.

## Key Conventions
- **File Organization:**
  - Each language has its own directory. Place new files in the appropriate folder.
  - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `assignment1.cpp`, `project.html`).
- **No Cross-Language Integration:**
  - Files do not interact across languages. Treat each as an isolated example.
- **No External Dependencies:**
  - All code is self-contained. Do not add package managers or external libraries unless explicitly requested.
- **No Project-Level Build/Test:**
  - There are no makefiles, CMakeLists, or test runners. Compile and run files individually as needed.

## Examples
- To add a new C++ example, create a file in `C++/` (e.g., `C++/loops.cpp`).
- To add a new HTML page, place it in `HTML/`.
- For C code, use the `code.c/` directory.

## AI Agent Guidance
- **Do not introduce new project structure or automation unless asked.**
- **Preserve the current folder structure and naming conventions.**
- **Document any new files or patterns in this file if they become common.**
